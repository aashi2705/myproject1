This project is a C++ implementation of a city transportation arrangement system that leverages graph theory and shortest path algorithms to efficiently connect users with the nearest available cab/auto-rickshaw service. 
The city is represented as a weighted graph(map of the city is given below), with nodes corresponding to locations and edges indicating distances between them. Users input their current location as any node/vertex of the graph and desired destination, and the system employs Floyd-Warshall's algorithm to find the shortest path in the graph. 
It maintains a list of available cabs at different nodes, determining the closest one to the user. The system calculates the travel distance and estimates the cost based on a fixed rate. It then outputs the nearest cab, travel distance, and cost to the user, facilitating efficient and cost-effective urban transportation. Please note that this is a simplified model, and a complete system would require accurate geographical data and additional features for a real-world implementation. Remember, this code will work only on this city, if you want to change the city then bring a new map and feed its edges in this code.
